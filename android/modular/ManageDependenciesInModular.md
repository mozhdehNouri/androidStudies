### Manager Gradle in Multi Modular Application



the common way to organize gradle plugin and dependecie in modular project is using buildSrc Approch but the BuildSrc has some pitfalls and weak points that i want to mention :



1. Build time: building the "buildSrc" folder can take a significant amount of time, even if none of the plugins defined in "buildSrc" are used in the current build. This can slow down the development process, especially if you are frequently making small changes to the project.
   
   - This is because the "buildSrc" folder is built before any other module in the project, even if none of the plugins defined in "buildSrc" are used in a given build. This can lead to unnecessary build time when working on smaller parts of the project.

2. Code duplication: When using the "buildSrc" folder, it's possible for different modules to define similar logic in their own build scripts. This can lead to duplicated code and potential inconsistencies across the project. By contrast, the "build-logic" approach allows you to define common configurations in a single location, reducing the likelihood of code duplication.

3. IDE integration: The "buildSrc" folder can sometimes cause issues with IDE integration and debugging, especially when using mixed-language projects with Kotlin and Java. This is because "buildSrc" is a separate module from the main project, which can lead to some inconsistencies between the two. With the "build-logic" approach, convention plugins are included as an "included build", which makes it easier to integrate with IDEs and debug the build process.

4. Limited scope: The "buildSrc" folder is limited in scope to custom Gradle plugins, whereas convention plugins can be used to define a wide range of configurations for different modules in the project. This allows for more flexibility in how you define and use plugins in your project.





Comparison between buildSrc and build-logic :

1. Scope: The "buildSrc" folder is intended to be used for defining custom Gradle plugins, while the "build-logic" approach is a more general approach to organizing Gradle projects. Convention plugins defined in "build-logic" can be used to configure all aspects of a project, not just custom plugins.

2. Dependencies: Plugins defined in "buildSrc" are automatically available to all subprojects in a multi-project build, but they are not available to the root project or any other builds outside the current project. Convention plugins defined in "build-logic", on the other hand, are available to any project that includes the "build-logic" project as an included build.

3. Build time: Because the "buildSrc" folder is compiled separately from the main project, it can add significant time to the build process. Convention plugins defined in "build-logic" are included as part of the build process and can be compiled along with the rest of the project, potentially reducing build time.

4. Flexibility: Convention plugins defined in "build-logic" can be designed to be composable and additive, allowing for greater flexibility in configuring different aspects of a project. By contrast, plugins defined in "buildSrc" are typically more focused on specific tasks and may be less flexible in their application.

5. Code duplication: Convention plugins defined in "build-logic" can help to reduce code duplication by providing a single source of truth for common configurations. With "buildSrc", it's possible for multiple subprojects to define similar logic in their own build scripts, leading to duplicated code and potential inconsistencies.

Overall, both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them will depend on the specific needs of your project. In general, if you only need to define custom Gradle plugins, the "buildSrc" folder may be the better choice. If you need more flexibility and want to avoid code duplication, the "build-logic" approach may be a better fit.
