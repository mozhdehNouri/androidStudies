Android Modularization 

what is Modularization :

Modularization is a means of structuring your codebase in a way that improves maintainability and helps avoid these problems.

ModularizationModularization is a practice of organizing a codebase into loosely coupled and self contained parts. Each part is a module. Each module is independent and serves a clear purpose. By dividing a problem into smaller and easier to solve subproblems, you reduce the complexity of designing and maintaining a large system.

Benefits of Modular :

- Reusability

- Scalability

- Ownership

- Encapsulation

- Testability

- Testability

what is a module :

A module is **a collection of source files and build settings that let you divide your project into discrete units of functionality**. Your project can have one or many modules, and one module can use another module as a dependency. You can independently build, test, and debug each module.

Modularization is an important aspect of building large-scale applications. It allows developers to break down an application into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. In the context of Android development, modularization can help improve build times, reduce code complexity, and make it easier to add new features and functionality to an application

There are several approaches to modularization in Android, including modularization by layer, modularization by feature, and hybrid approaches that combine these two approaches.

Modularization by Layer :

Modularization by layer involves breaking down an application into separate modules based on the different layers of the application architecture. For example, an Android application typically has a presentation layer (UI), a domain layer (business logic), and a data layer (data access). Each of these layers can be modularized into separate modules that can be developed and tested independently.

Modularization by Feature:

Modularization by feature involves breaking down an application into separate modules based on the different features or use cases of the application. For example, an e-commerce application might have separate modules for product search, product details, shopping cart, and checkout.

Modularization by feature can help improve code organization and make it easier to add new features and functionality to an application. However, it can also lead to duplication of code and dependencies between different feature modules.

Hybrid Approaches

Hybrid approaches combine modularization by layer and modularization by feature. For example, an application might have separate modules for the presentation layer, domain layer, and data layer, but also have separate modules for each feature or use case of the application.

Hybrid approaches can help balance the benefits of modularization by layer and modularization by feature, but can also lead to increased complexity and dependencies between modules.

Conclusion

Modularization is an important aspect of building large-scale Android applications. There are several approaches to modularization, including modularization by layer, modularization by feature, and hybrid approaches that combine these two approaches. Each approach has its own benefits and drawbacks, and the choice of approach depends on the specific needs and requirements of the application being developed.

##### Layer vs. Feature Separation

One of the most common ways of Modularization in the old days was to separate the presentation and data layer (aka domain-data-presentation). It took the developers a while to find out that the domain-data-presentation layer was no longer enough to apply Modularization. Separating only these layers will target the small projects, and you wouldn’t benefit from the reasons mentioned above. Because when you develop a Feature, you will touch all the layers, and guess what? You will turn a lot of heads, and all of your layers will recompile every time.

That’s why I want to demonstrate how the incremental build works in the next section. You may be surprised that this layering in your project (without Feature separation) wouldn’t help you have isolated Features.

By incremental build, the build process can run independently in a shorter time than when you only have three modules for your data, domain, and presentation of the entire app. Instead, by Feature separation, you will have more isolated modules, and then you can apply these layers on each Feature module if you are interested. You can read more about these topics [here](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PresentationDomainDataLayering.html) and [here](https://markonovakovic.medium.com/clean-architecture-is-not-domain-data-presentation-e368d7ff8579).



###### Don't Do These Fatal Mistakes With a Multi-Module Architecture :

each module can build independently using gradle .



each module can build in parallel and it only rebuild the modulas that actually change and that make the build a little faster.



##### mistake 1:

the first mistake you can do  it is you modular your project at first.  

There is no need to make your project modular if it is not necessary. the most of time your project no need to be modular because your project is small and when you modular it you just add complexity in your projet.



##### mistake 2 :

never use of layer-base approch to module your project .

![1](C:\Users\mozhdeh.nouri\Desktop\all_basic.png)



let's Comparison the modular approch benifit will pass in layer-base or not :



the first benfit is build time :

UI module depends on the domain module and the domain module depend on data module 
if any change happens data module domain and ui module rebuild 

the second reusability :

you can't separate the data module and put it in another project.

third benefit delegation :

broke your code you cant use for example team A worked on Module A and Team B work on Module B 



the best practice is to use a hybrid approach for modularize :

first separate module by feature and in the module you have different modules and separate by layer

question :

1- the best and optimize way modularing 

2- why my modular make  my gradle build long

3- how modular can help to build time ?
