# Semantics

the composition is a state aware tree of composable. this is how composed does all of its magic with state and we give it new state how its able to recompose call our composable function again





we have a compostion tree  :A Composition describes the UI  of your app and is produced by running composables. The Composition is a tree-structure that consists of the composables that describe your UI.


so as i mentioned the composition tree  earlier the semantics tree  is something that actully lives in parallel to the composition and it describe the semantic meaning of composables . so things it gave us that kind of meaning behind all these composable functions that we are writing .





ho do we support accessibility and testing no post how do we support finding these ui elements getting that metadata : as you probably guessed by now semantics are the answer to that it is magics are here to rescue us





 why do I need semantics ?
