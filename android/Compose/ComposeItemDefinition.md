### Modifier Params

```kts
modifier = Modifier.heightIn(min = 56.dp)
```

used to specify the minimum height of a composable component. It allows you to set a minimum height constraint for the component.

 sets the minimum height of the composable component to 56 density-independent pixels (dp). Let's break down the parameters:

- `min`: This parameter specifies the minimum height value for the component. It is expressed in dp (density-independent pixels) and determines the minimum vertical space the component should occupy.

By applying the `Modifier.heightIn` modifier to a composable, you ensure that the component will have a minimum height of 56 dp. If the component's content requires more vertical space, it will expand accordingly.

In Jetpack Compose, the `toggleable` modifier is used to make a component toggleable, meaning it can be switched between two states. This modifier enables the component to respond to user input and accessibility events.

Here's an example using a `Box` composable:

```kt
var isSelected by remember { mutableStateOf(false) } 
Box( modifier = 
Modifier .toggleable( value = isSelected,
 onValueChange = { isSelected = it } ) .size(100.dp)
 .background(if (isSelected) Color.Red else Color.Blue) )
```

In this example, we have a `Box` composable that represents a toggleable component. 

toggleable means a component has two status like switch on/off

The state of the toggleable component is controlled by the `isSelected` variable, which is initially set to `false`.

The `toggleable` modifier is applied to the `Box` and takes two parameters:

- `value = isSelected`: This parameter represents the current state of the toggleable component, which is `isSelected`. It determines whether the component is in the "on" or "off" state.

- `onValueChange = { isSelected = it }`: This is a callback function that is invoked when the state of the toggleable component changes. The new state is passed as `it`, and in this case, we update the `isSelected` variable to reflect the new state.

Additionally, we apply other modifiers to the `Box`:

- `.size(100.dp)`: This modifier sets the size of the `Box` to 100 density-independent pixels (dp).

- `.background(if (isSelected) Color.Red else Color.Blue)`: This modifier sets the background color of the `Box` to red if `isSelected` is `true`, and blue if `isSelected` is `false`.

With this setup, when the user interacts with the `Box` by clicking or tapping it, the `onValueChange` callback is triggered, and the `isSelected` variable is updated to the new state. Consequently, the background color of the `Box` changes based on the updated state, providing a visual indication of the toggleable behavior.

look at another example :

```kt
@Composable
fun CheckableText(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    text: String,
    checked: Boolean,
    onCheckChange: (Boolean) -> Unit,
) {
    Row(
        modifier.then(
            Modifier
                .clip(MaterialTheme.shapes.small)
                .toggleable(
                    value = checked,
                    role = Role.Checkbox,
                    onValueChange = onCheckChange
                )
                .padding(vertical = 8.dp)
        ),
        verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically
    ) {
        Checkbox(
            checked = checked,
            onCheckedChange = null,
            colors = CheckboxDefaults.colors(
                checkedColor = MaterialTheme.colors.primary,
                checkmarkColor = MaterialTheme.colors.onPrimary
            )
        )
        Spacer(modifier = Modifier.width(8.dp))
        Text(
            text = text,
            color = MaterialTheme.colors.onSurface,
            style = MaterialTheme.typography.button
        )
    }
}}
    )
)
```

1 - we want to toggleable text and checkBox so we to add it to Row 
2 - when we use toggle doesn't need to set onClick and use like this `check=!chek` the togglead has lambda and pass value too use
3- we can remove the ripper from the toggle  

4 - it's used most of for visually impaired people

[Surface](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65918835/when-should-i-use-android-jetpack-compose-surface-composable#:~:text=There's%20Surface%20composable%20in%20Jetpack,might%20be%20done%20using%20modifiers.) 

```kt
@Composable
fun Surface(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    shape: Shape = RectangleShape,
    color: Color = MaterialTheme.colors.surface,
    contentColor: Color = contentColorFor(color),
    border: BorderStroke? = null,
    elevation: Dp = 0.dp,
    content: @Composable () -> Unit
): Unit
```

when we should use Surface : 

A surface **allows you to setup things like background color or border** but it seems that the same might be done using modifiers

[Surface](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/package-summary#surface) composable makes the code easier as well as explicitly indicates that the code uses a [material surface](https://material.io/design/environment/surfaces.html).

look at this example :

we want to have  a text with a  border and reduse 
use with Surface :

```kt
Surface(
    color = MaterialTheme.colors.primarySurface,
    border = BorderStroke(1.dp, MaterialTheme.colors.secondary),
    shape = RoundedCornerShape(8.dp),
    elevation = 8.dp
) {
    Text(
        text = "example",
        modifier = Modifier.padding(8.dp)
    )
}
```

with out using Surface :

```kt
val shape = RoundedCornerShape(8.dp)
val shadowElevationPx = with(LocalDensity.current) { 2.dp.toPx() }
val backgroundColor = MaterialTheme.colors.primarySurface

Text(
    text = "example",
    color = contentColorFor(backgroundColor),
    modifier = Modifier
        .graphicsLayer(shape = shape, shadowElevation = shadowElevationPx)
        .background(backgroundColor, shape)
        .border(1.dp, MaterialTheme.colors.secondary, shape)
        .padding(8.dp)
)
```

#### Modifier.zIndex

look at this example :

```kt
Box(
    modifier = Modifier
        .size(100.dp)
        .background(Color.Red)
        .zIndex(1f)
) {
    // Content of the first composable
}

Box(
    modifier = Modifier
        .size(100.dp)
        .background(Color.Blue)
        .zIndex(2f)
) {
    // Content of the second composable
}

```

In this example, we have two `Box` composables, one with a red background and the other with a blue background. The first composable has a lower `zIndex` value of 1, while the second composable has a higher `zIndex` value of 2.

As a result, the second `Box` with the blue background will be rendered above the first `Box` with the red background because it has a higher `zIndex`. This determines the visual stacking order, with higher `zIndex` values appearing on top of lower values.

You should use `Modifier.zIndex` when you want explicit control over the elevation and visual layering of composables within a layout. It is useful in scenarios where you have overlapping elements or when you need to ensure a specific order of appearance.

When we talk about the "visual stacking order" of composables within a layout, we refer to how they appear on top of each other. In other words, it determines which composables are visually displayed above others.

when we can use it :

like floating action Button what you want to sure is top on component.
