### Modifier Params

```kts
modifier = Modifier.heightIn(min = 56.dp)
```

used to specify the minimum height of a composable component. It allows you to set a minimum height constraint for the component.

 sets the minimum height of the composable component to 56 density-independent pixels (dp). Let's break down the parameters:

- `min`: This parameter specifies the minimum height value for the component. It is expressed in dp (density-independent pixels) and determines the minimum vertical space the component should occupy.

By applying the `Modifier.heightIn` modifier to a composable, you ensure that the component will have a minimum height of 56 dp. If the component's content requires more vertical space, it will expand accordingly.

In Jetpack Compose, the `toggleable` modifier is used to make a component toggleable, meaning it can be switched between two states. This modifier enables the component to respond to user input and accessibility events.

Here's an example using a `Box` composable:

```kt
var isSelected by remember { mutableStateOf(false) } 
Box( modifier = 
Modifier .toggleable( value = isSelected,
 onValueChange = { isSelected = it } ) .size(100.dp)
 .background(if (isSelected) Color.Red else Color.Blue) )
```

In this example, we have a `Box` composable that represents a toggleable component. 

toggleable means a component has two status like switch on/off

The state of the toggleable component is controlled by the `isSelected` variable, which is initially set to `false`.

The `toggleable` modifier is applied to the `Box` and takes two parameters:

- `value = isSelected`: This parameter represents the current state of the toggleable component, which is `isSelected`. It determines whether the component is in the "on" or "off" state.

- `onValueChange = { isSelected = it }`: This is a callback function that is invoked when the state of the toggleable component changes. The new state is passed as `it`, and in this case, we update the `isSelected` variable to reflect the new state.

Additionally, we apply other modifiers to the `Box`:

- `.size(100.dp)`: This modifier sets the size of the `Box` to 100 density-independent pixels (dp).

- `.background(if (isSelected) Color.Red else Color.Blue)`: This modifier sets the background color of the `Box` to red if `isSelected` is `true`, and blue if `isSelected` is `false`.

With this setup, when the user interacts with the `Box` by clicking or tapping it, the `onValueChange` callback is triggered, and the `isSelected` variable is updated to the new state. Consequently, the background color of the `Box` changes based on the updated state, providing a visual indication of the toggleable behavior.

look at another example :

```kt
@Composable
fun CheckableText(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    text: String,
    checked: Boolean,
    onCheckChange: (Boolean) -> Unit,
) {
    Row(
        modifier.then(
            Modifier
                .clip(MaterialTheme.shapes.small)
                .toggleable(
                    value = checked,
                    role = Role.Checkbox,
                    onValueChange = onCheckChange
                )
                .padding(vertical = 8.dp)
        ),
        verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically
    ) {
        Checkbox(
            checked = checked,
            onCheckedChange = null,
            colors = CheckboxDefaults.colors(
                checkedColor = MaterialTheme.colors.primary,
                checkmarkColor = MaterialTheme.colors.onPrimary
            )
        )
        Spacer(modifier = Modifier.width(8.dp))
        Text(
            text = text,
            color = MaterialTheme.colors.onSurface,
            style = MaterialTheme.typography.button
        )
    }
}}
    )
)
```

1 - we want to toggleable text and checkBox so we to add it to Row 
2 - when we use toggle doesn't need to set onClick and use like this `check=!chek` the togglead has lambda and pass value too use
3- we can remove the ripper from the toggle  

4 - it's used most of for visually impaired people

[Surface](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65918835/when-should-i-use-android-jetpack-compose-surface-composable#:~:text=There's%20Surface%20composable%20in%20Jetpack,might%20be%20done%20using%20modifiers.) 

```kt
@Composable
fun Surface(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    shape: Shape = RectangleShape,
    color: Color = MaterialTheme.colors.surface,
    contentColor: Color = contentColorFor(color),
    border: BorderStroke? = null,
    elevation: Dp = 0.dp,
    content: @Composable () -> Unit
): Unit
```

when we should use Surface : 

A surface **allows you to setup things like background color or border** but it seems that the same might be done using modifiers

[Surface](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/package-summary#surface) composable makes the code easier as well as explicitly indicates that the code uses a [material surface](https://material.io/design/environment/surfaces.html).

look at this example :

we want to have  a text with a  border and reduse 
use with Surface :

```kt
Surface(
    color = MaterialTheme.colors.primarySurface,
    border = BorderStroke(1.dp, MaterialTheme.colors.secondary),
    shape = RoundedCornerShape(8.dp),
    elevation = 8.dp
) {
    Text(
        text = "example",
        modifier = Modifier.padding(8.dp)
    )
}
```

with out using Surface :

```kt
val shape = RoundedCornerShape(8.dp)
val shadowElevationPx = with(LocalDensity.current) { 2.dp.toPx() }
val backgroundColor = MaterialTheme.colors.primarySurface

Text(
    text = "example",
    color = contentColorFor(backgroundColor),
    modifier = Modifier
        .graphicsLayer(shape = shape, shadowElevation = shadowElevationPx)
        .background(backgroundColor, shape)
        .border(1.dp, MaterialTheme.colors.secondary, shape)
        .padding(8.dp)
)
```

----------------

#### Modifier.zIndex

look at this example :

```kt
Box(
    modifier = Modifier
        .size(100.dp)
        .background(Color.Red)
        .zIndex(1f)
) {
    // Content of the first composable
}

Box(
    modifier = Modifier
        .size(100.dp)
        .background(Color.Blue)
        .zIndex(2f)
) {
    // Content of the second composable
}
```

In this example, we have two `Box` composables, one with a red background and the other with a blue background. The first composable has a lower `zIndex` value of 1, while the second composable has a higher `zIndex` value of 2.

As a result, the second `Box` with the blue background will be rendered above the first `Box` with the red background because it has a higher `zIndex`. This determines the visual stacking order, with higher `zIndex` values appearing on top of lower values.

You should use `Modifier.zIndex` when you want explicit control over the elevation and visual layering of composables within a layout. It is useful in scenarios where you have overlapping elements or when you need to ensure a specific order of appearance.

When we talk about the "visual stacking order" of composables within a layout, we refer to how they appear on top of each other. In other words, it determines which composables are visually displayed above others.

when we can use it :

like floating action Button what you want to sure is top on component.

----

#### Modifier.clip

To clip the composable to the region it's drawn in, you can add another `Modifier.clip(RectangleShape)` at the start of the modifier chain. The content then remains inside of the original bounds.

 Rectangle shape, Rounded corner shape, Circle shape, and Cut corner shape.

```kt
 modifier = Modifier
                .size(150.dp)
                //.clip(RoundedCornerShape(0.dp))
                .clip(RoundedCornerShape(12.dp))
                //.clip(RoundedCornerShape(topEnd = 20.dp, bottomStart = 20.dp))
                //.clip(androidx.compose.foundation.shape.CircleShape)

                // * set height & width for rectangle shape : eg .size(150.dp,100.dp)
                //.clip(RoundedCornerShape(12.dp))
                //.clip(CutCornerShape(12.dp))
                .background(Color.Black),
```



another example :

```kt
Column(modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)) {
    Box(
        modifier = Modifier
            .clip(RectangleShape)
            .size(200.dp)
            .border(2.dp, Color.Black)
            .graphicsLayer {
                clip = true
                shape = CircleShape
                translationY = 50.dp.toPx()
            }
            .background(Color(0xFFF06292))
    ) {
        Text(
            "Hello Compose",
            style = TextStyle(color = Color.Black, fontSize = 46.sp),
            modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.Center)
        )
    }

    Box(
        modifier = Modifier
            .size(200.dp)
            .clip(RoundedCornerShape(500.dp))
            .background(Color(0xFF4DB6AC))
    )
}
```

###### different between wrapContentWidth and align

```kt
  Text(
                modifier = Modifier
                    .weight(1f)
                    .wrapContentWidth(Alignment.Start)
            )
```

```kt
Modifier.align(Alignment.CenterVertically)
```

`modifier.wrapContentSizeWidth(Alignment.Start)`: This modifier is typically used to wrap the width of a UI element to its content size, allowing the element to take up only as much width as necessary. The `Alignment.Start` parameter specifies that the element should be aligned to the start (left) edge of its parent container. This means that the element's content will be aligned to the left while taking up the minimum required width.



`modifier.align(Alignment.CenterVertically)`: This modifier is used to align a UI element within its parent container along the vertical axis. The `Alignment.CenterVertically` parameter specifies that the element should be centered vertically within its parent container. This means that the element's vertical midpoint will be aligned with the vertical midpoint of its parent.
