we can use @Composable as a part of input function 

```kt
@Composable
fun AnimatingFabContent(
    icon: @Composable () -> Unit,
    text: @Composable () -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    extended: Boolean = true
)
```

### Layout :

In Compose, UI elements are represented by the composable functions that emit a piece of UI when invoked, that is then added to a UI tree that gets rendered on the screen. Each UI element has one parent and potentially many children. Each element is also located within its parent, specified as an (x, y) position, and a size, specified as aÂ `width`Â and aÂ `height`.

Parents define the constraints for their child elements. An element is asked to define its size within those constraints

Laying out each node in the UI tree is a three step process. Each node must:

1. Measure any children
2. Decide its own size
3. Place its children

Measuring a layout can only be done during the measurement and layout passes, and a child can only be placed during the layout passes.

```kt
fun Modifier.customLayoutModifier() =
    layout { measurable, constraints ->
        // ...
    }
```

TheÂ `layout`Â modifier only changes the calling composable.

```kt
Text("Hi there!", Modifier.firstBaselineToTop(32.dp))
```

Â To measure and layout multiple composables, use theÂ `Layout`Â composable instead. This composable allows you to measure and lay out children manually. All higher-level layouts likeÂ `Column`Â andÂ `Row`Â are built with theÂ `Layout`Â composable.

**note**:  In the View system, creating a custom layout required extendingÂ `ViewGroup` and implementing measure and layout functions. In Compose you simply write a function using theÂ `Layout`Â composable.

Layout Example 

```kt
@Composable
fun MyBasicColumn(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    content: @Composable () -> Unit
) {
    Layout(
        modifier = modifier,
        content = content
    ) { measurables, constraints ->
        // measure and position children given constraints logic here
        // ...
    }
}
```

## then

we can **then** on modifier to attach 2 modifier together 

for example

```kt
    val backgroundModifier = if (selected) {
        Modifier.background(
            color = LocalContentColor.current,
            shape = RoundedCornerShape(14.dp)
        )
    } else {
        Modifier
    }
```

usage :

```kt
 IconButton(
        onClick = onClick,
        modifier = modifier.then(backgroundModifier)
    )
```

 or we can use like this :

```kt
paddingSizeModifier.then(Modifier.clip(CircleShape))
```

## CenterAlignAppBar

it comes from material 3 

the title will be centered  when we use centerAlignAppBar because of 

<u>centeredTitle = true,</u>

in this AppBar  we have one parameter  and that name is 

```kt
scrollBehavior: TopAppBarScrollBehavior? = null
```

and for behavior ,we use this item 

```kt
  val topBarState = rememberTopAppBarState()

  val scrollBehavior = TopAppBarDefaults.pinnedScrollBehavior(topBarState)
```

TopAppBarDefaults = Contains default values used for the top app bar implementations.

pinnedScrollBehavior = Returns a pinned TopAppBarScrollBehavior that tracks nested-scroll callbacks and updates its TopAppBarState.contentOffset accordingly.

action   = this used for CenterAppBar  and its not and action 
actully it is an composable scope we can define an icon 

according to the document definition =
**the actions displayed at the end of the top app bar. This should typically be IconButtons. The default layout here is a Row, so icons inside will be placed horizontally**

----

#### @DrawableRes

@DrawableRes is an annotation that can be usedÂ **to indicate that an integer parameter, field or method return value is expected to be a drawable resource reference**Â (e.g. R. drawable. my_image ). This annotation is used by the Android build tools to validate that the resource reference is valid at compile time.

----

## Semantics :

Compose usesÂ *semantics properties*Â to pass information to accessibility services. Semantics properties provide information about UI elements that are displayed to the user. Most built-in composables likeÂ [`Text`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/package-summary#Text(kotlin.String,androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Color,androidx.compose.ui.unit.TextUnit,androidx.compose.ui.text.font.FontStyle,androidx.compose.ui.text.font.FontWeight,androidx.compose.ui.text.font.FontFamily,androidx.compose.ui.unit.TextUnit,androidx.compose.ui.text.style.TextDecoration,androidx.compose.ui.text.style.TextAlign,androidx.compose.ui.unit.TextUnit,androidx.compose.ui.text.style.TextOverflow,kotlin.Boolean,kotlin.Int,kotlin.Function1,androidx.compose.ui.text.TextStyle))Â andÂ [`Button`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/package-summary#Button(kotlin.Function0,androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,kotlin.Boolean,androidx.compose.foundation.interaction.MutableInteractionSource,androidx.compose.material.ButtonElevation,androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Shape,androidx.compose.foundation.BorderStroke,androidx.compose.material.ButtonColors,androidx.compose.foundation.layout.PaddingValues,kotlin.Function1))Â fill these semantics properties with information inferred from the composable and its children. Some modifiers likeÂ [`toggleable`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/selection/package-summary#toggleable(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,kotlin.Boolean,kotlin.Boolean,androidx.compose.ui.semantics.Role,kotlin.Function1))Â andÂ [`clickable`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/package-summary#clickable(androidx.compose.ui.Modifier,kotlin.Boolean,kotlin.String,androidx.compose.ui.semantics.Role,kotlin.Function0))Â will also set certain semantics properties. However, sometimes the framework needs more information to understand how to describe a UI element to the user.

A Composition[describes the UI](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/mental-model)of your
app and is produced by running composables. The Composition is a tree-structure that consists of the
composables that describe your UI.

Next to the Composition, there exists a parallel tree, called the*Semantics tree*. This tree
describes your UI in an alternative manner that is understandable
for[Accessibility](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/accessibility)services and for
the[Testing](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/testing)framework. Accessibility services
use the tree to describe the app to users with a specific need. The Testing framework uses it to
interact with your app and make assertions about it. The Semantics tree does not contain the
information on how to*draw*your composables, but it contains information about the*
*semantic*meaning***of your composables.

---

key point of lifecycle and remember :
The`remember`ed stuff only lasts till the Composable gets destroyed. If you navigate to another
screen, the previous Composables are destroyed and along with them, the scroll state

@Immutable annotion in compose android

- `Immutable`can be used to mark a class that produces immutable instances. In short, a class that
  has all public fields declared as`val`.
- This is a promise to the compose compiler that
  ***once the object is constructed, the properties inside it won't change at runtime***.
- Immutable is used by a composition that enables composition optimizations that can be performed
  based on the assumption that values read from the type will not change.

So, when you use the "@Immutable" sticker on a class in your computer program, it tells the computer
that the things inside that class (we call them properties) won't change after they're created. This
helps the computer do some clever things to make your program work faster and better because it
knows that nothing in that class will change while it's playing with it.

In Compose, when you use the `@Immutable` sticker on a class, it's like telling Compose that the things inside that class won't change. This is really helpful for Compose because it can do some cool tricks to make your app run smoother and faster.

Similarly, when Compose knows that the data in a class won't change (thanks to `@Immutable`), it can build your app's user interface more efficiently. It can be confident that the data it's using to create the interface won't suddenly change, so it can make your app run faster and work better.

[Promise compose compiler and imply when you&#x27;ll change ðŸ¤ž](https://blog.shreyaspatil.dev/promise-compose-compiler-and-imply-when-youll-change)     read this article for improve composable perforamce

---

you can write code like this  :

```kt
class ConversationUiState(
    val channelName: String,
    val channelMembers: Int,
    initialMessages: List<Message>
) {
    private val _messages: MutableList<Message> = initialMessages.toMutableStateList()
    val messages: List<Message> = _messages

    fun addMessage(msg: Message) {
        _messages.add(0, msg) // Add to the beginning of the list
    }
}
```

**toMutableStateList**: Create an instance of MutableList from a collection that is observable and can be snapshot.

---

Modifier.testTag("")

Applies a tag to allow modified element to be found in tests.
This is a convenience method for a semantics that sets SemanticsPropertyReceiver.testTag.

## Semantics

UI tests in Compose useÂ *semantics*Â to interact with the UI hierarchy. Semantics, as the name implies, give meaning to a piece of UI. In this context, a "piece of UI" (or element) can mean anything from a single composable to a full screen. TheÂ *semantics tree*Â is generated alongside the UI hierarchy, and describes it.

if you want to konw what is diffrent between these lets continue :

- `Modifier.testTag`: It's like putting a name on a toy. It helps you find and use a specific thing in your app when you want to test or interact with it.

- `Modifier.semantics`: It's like telling your friend how a toy works, so they can use it properly. It's not just for testing; it's also for helping people who might need assistance using your app.

**reverseLayout = true in lazyColumn**

if our list is  

val list = listOf("a","b","c")

then when you reverseLayout = true

you can see your item like this : c,b,a

---

LocalUriHandler.current
Certainly! In Jetpack Compose, `LocalUriHandler.current` is a tool that helps you open web links or handle URIs in your app. It's like having a special button to deal with website links. You can use it to tell your app what to do when someone clicks on a web link.

```kt
@Composable
fun OpenWebLink() {
    val uriHandler = LocalUriHandler.current

    // You can use uriHandler to open a web link when needed.
    uriHandler.openUri("https://www.example.com")
}
```
