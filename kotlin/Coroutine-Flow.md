A coroutine is a very efficient and complete framework to manage concurrency in a more performant and simple way.

 coroutine allows running heavy tasks away from UI Thread in the background, which ultimately gives a smooth and better experience to the user of the app.

you can't do heavy opration like networking or data base... in ui thread your app will be freezing  you have to using background thread .

#### What are Coroutines?

Coroutines = Co + Routines

Here, **Co** means **cooperation** and **Routines** means **functions**.

It means that when functions cooperate with each other, we call it Coroutines.

- It will enable writing asynchronous code in a synchronous way.

- Overall, the Coroutines make multitasking very easy.

-  **Coroutines** and the threads both are multitasking. But the difference is that threads are managed by the OS and **coroutines by the users** as it can execute a few lines of function by taking advantage of the cooperation.

- a coroutine is a lightweight and efficient way of performing concurrent or asynchronous programming. Coroutines allow you to suspend the execution of a function without blocking the thread, and then resume it later when the desired condition is met.

-  **Coroutines** are lightweight threads .A lightweight thread means it doesn't map on the native thread, so it doesn't require context switching on the processor, so they are faster.

- coroutine is a lightweight thread that can be used to perform non-blocking operations.
  
  - coroutines are often used to perform long-running or blocking operations, such as network requests or disk I/O, without blocking the main thread.
  
  - This can improve app responsiveness and prevent the app from freezing or crashing.

- coroutines are often referred to as "lightweight threads" because they provide a way to perform concurrent or asynchronous programming without the overhead and resource consumption of traditional threads.
  
  When a traditional thread is created, it requires a certain amount of system resources, such as memory and CPU time, to manage its state and execute its code. Creating a large number of threads can lead to resource exhaustion and decreased performance, especially in applications that perform I/O-bound operations.
  
  Coroutines, on the other hand, are much lighter in terms of resource consumption. They are implemented as suspending functions that can be paused and resumed without creating a new thread. When a coroutine is suspended, it releases the thread that was executing it, allowing other coroutines or tasks to use the same thread. This makes coroutines more efficient and scalable than traditional threads, especially in situations where a large number of concurrent operations are needed.

another difinition :

Coroutines is the recommended solution for **asynchronous programming on Android.**

advantage of coroutine :

- **Lightweight**: One can run many coroutines on a single thread due to support for suspension, which doesn’t block the thread where the coroutine is running. Suspending frees memory over blocking while supporting multiple concurrent operations.
- **Built-in cancellation support**: Cancellation is generated automatically through the running coroutine hierarchy.
- **Fewer memory leaks**: It uses structured concurrency to run operations within a scope.
- **Jetpack integration**: Many Jetpack libraries include extensions that provide full coroutines support. Some libraries also provide their own coroutine scope that one can use for structured concurrency.

#### Kotlin Coroutines vs Threads

- Fetching the data from one thread and passing it to another thread takes a lot of time. It also introduces lots of callbacks, leading to less readability of code. On the other hand, coroutines eliminate callbacks.
- Creating and stopping a thread is an expensive job, as it involves creating their own stacks.,whereas creating coroutines is very cheap when compared to the performance it offers. coroutines do not have their own stack.
- Threads are blocking, whereas coroutines are suspendable. By blocking it means that when a thread sleeps for some duration, the entire threads get blocked, it cannot do any other operation, whereas since coroutines are suspendable, so when they are delayed for some seconds, they can perform any other work.
- Coroutines offer a very high level of concurrency as compared to threads, as multiple threads involve blocking and context switching. Context switching with threads is slower as compared to coroutines, as with threads context can only be switched when the job of 1 thread gets over, but with coroutines, they can change context any time, as they are suspendable.
- Coroutines are light and super fast. Coroutines are faster than threads, as threads are managed by Operating System, whereas coroutines are managed by users. Having thousands of coroutines working together are much better than having tens of threads working together.

What does it mean when I say "it doesn't map on the native thread"?

**Coroutines** are available in many languages. Basically, there are two types of Coroutines:

- Stackless
- Stackful

Kotlin implements stackless coroutines - it means that the coroutines don't have their own stack, so they don't map on the native thread.

###### official  website of kotlin :

One can think of a coroutine as a light-weight thread. Like threads, coroutines can run in parallel, wait for each other and communicate. The biggest difference is that coroutines are very cheap, almost free: we can create thousands of them, and pay very little in terms of performance. True threads, on the other hand, are expensive to start and keep around. A thousand threads can be a serious challenge for a modern machine.

**Coroutines do not replace threads, it's more like a framework to manage them.**

##### another difinition :

**The official documentation says that coroutines are lightweight threads. By lightweight,** **it means that creating coroutines doesn’t allocate new threads. Instead, they use predefined thread pools and smart scheduling for the purpose of which task to execute next and which tasks later**

##### coroutine is thread ?

coroutines are not threads. Instead, coroutines are a lightweight concurrency mechanism that can be used to perform concurrent or asynchronous tasks. Coroutines allow you to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and structured way, without the overhead of creating and managing threads.

Unlike threads, which are managed by the operating system and can execute in parallel on multiple CPUs, coroutines are cooperative and rely on a single thread of execution. The Kotlin coroutine framework manages the scheduling of coroutines, allowing them to suspend and resume execution at specific points in their code without blocking the underlying thread.

 These include RxJava, AsyncTasks, Jobs, Threads.

##### So why there is a need to learn something new?

- While Using Rx, it requires a lot of effort to get it enough, to use it safely.

-  On the Other hand, AsyncTasks and threads can easily introduce leaks and memory overhead

- Even using these tools after so many disadvantages, the code can suffer from callbacks, which can introduce tons of extra code

- On Android, Every app has a main thread (which handles all the UI operations like drawing views and other user interactions. If there is too much work happening on this main thread, like network calls (eg fetching a web page), the apps will appear to hang or slow down leading to poor user experience.

why we need coroutine :

 Lets take an example

- Fetch the User from the server.
- Show the User in the UI.

```kt
fun fetchAndShowUser() {
    val user = fetchUser()
    showUser(user)
}

fun fetchUser(): User {
    // make network call
    // return user
}

fun showUser(user: User) {
    // show user
}
```

When we call the `fetchAndShowUser` function, it will throw the `NetworkOnMainThreadException` as the network call is not allowed on the main thread.

There are many ways to solve that. A few of them are as follows:

1. **Using Callback**: Here, we run the fetchUser in the background thread and we pass the result with the callback.

```kt
fun fetchAndShowUser() {
    fetchUser { user ->
        showUser(user)
    }
}

fun fetchUser(callback: (User) -> Unit)) {
    // make network call on background thread to get user
    // callback with user
    callback(user)
}

fun showUser(user: User) {
    // show user
}
```

Let's see another example in which we have three nested network calls.

```kotlin
fun fetchData() {
    fetchA { a ->
        fetchB(a) { b ->
            fetchC(b) { c ->
                // do something with c
            }
        }
    }
}
```

2. **Using RxJava**: Reactive world approach. This way we can get rid of the nested callback.

```kotlin
fetchUser()
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    .observerOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe { user ->
        showUser(user)
    }

fun fetchUser(): Single<User> {
    // make network call
    // emit user
}

fun showUser(user: User) {
    // show user
}
```

3. **Using Coroutines**: Yes, coroutines.

```kotlin
fun fetchAndShowUser() {
    GlobalScope.launch(Dispatchers.Main) {
        val user = fetchUser() // fetch on IO thread
        showUser(user) // back on UI thread
    }
}

suspend fun fetchUser(): User {
    return withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        // make network call on IO thread
        // return user
    }
}

fun showUser(user: User) {
    // show user
```

By writing the `launch`, we launch a **coroutine** to do a task

```kt
GlobalScope.launch { // do something here }
```

coroutine item :

##### suspend function :

Suspend function is a function that could be started, paused, and resume.

what exactly ? lets take an example :

<img src="file:///C:/Users/mozhdeh.nouri/Pictures/suspend-function-in-kotlin-coroutines.webp" title="" alt="a" width="460">

example definition 

- `functionA` was running.
- `functionA` was suspended after some time.
- While the `functionA` was suspended, `functionB` started running and finished its work.
- Then again, `functionA` started running.

 One of the most important points to remember about the suspend functions is that they are only allowed to be called from a [coroutine](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kotlin-coroutines-on-android/) or another suspend function

syntax :

```kt
suspend fun doSomething(request: Request): Response {
     // do something
}
```

when we decompile code we can see a function without suspend keyword wand with an extra k parameter of the type Continuation

```kt
fun doSomething(request: Request, continuation: Continuation)...
```

The `Continuation<T>` is an interface which looks like below:

```kt
public interface Continuation<in T> {
    public val context: CoroutineContext
    public fun resumeWith(result: Result<T>)
}
```

- **context** will be the CoroutineContext to be used in that continuation.

- **resumeWith** resumes execution of the coroutine with a Result

 it has two extension functions:

```kt
fun <T> Continuation<T>.resume(value: T)

fun <T> Continuation<T>.resumeWithException(exception: Throwable)
```

they can be used to resume the coroutine with a return value or with an exception if an error had occurred while the function was suspended.

a function could be started, paused, and resume with the help of **Continuation**. We just have to use the **suspend** keyword.

**Note:** Suspend functions are only allowed to be called from a coroutine or another suspend function. You can see that the **async** function which includes the keyword **suspend**. So, in order to use that, we need to make our function **suspend** too.

**Dispatchers :**

- It is known that [coroutines](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kotlin-coroutines-on-android/) are always started in a specific context, and that context describes in which threads the coroutine will be started in.

- Dispatchers help [coroutines](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kotlin-coroutines-on-android/) in deciding the thread on which the work has to be done

- Dispatchers in Kotlin coroutines define different thread pools for different use cases

- An important functionality offered by the Kotlin Coroutines library is letting us decide on which thread (or pool of threads) a coroutine should be running (starting and resuming). This is done using dispatchers.

- [*When you launch a coroutine, you can specify the coroutine context. The coroutine context includes a coroutine dispatcher that determines what thread or threads the corresponding coroutine uses for its execution.*](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutine-context-and-dispatchers.html#dispatchers-and-threads)
  
  [*All coroutine builders like launch and async accept an optional CoroutineContext parameter that can be used to explicitly specify the dispatcher for the new coroutine and other context elements.*](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutine-context-and-dispatchers.html#dispatchers-and-threads)

### Types of Dispatchers

There are majorly 4 types of Dispatchers.

1. **Main  Dispatcher**
2. **IO Dispatcher**
3. **Default Dispatcher**
4. **Unconfined Dispatcher**

#### - **Main Dispatcher:**

It starts the coroutine in the main thread. It is mostly used when we need to perform the UI operations within the coroutine, as UI can only be changed from the main

```kt
GlobalScope.launch(Dispatchers.Main) {
    Log.i("Inside Global Scope ",Thread.currentThread().name.toString())
        // getting the name of thread in which
            // our coroutine has been launched
    }
    Log.i("Main Activity ",Thread.currentThread().name.toString())
```

#### **IO Dispatcher:**

We should use `Dispatchers.IO` to perform disk or network I/O-related tasks.

Example use cases:

- Any network operations like making a network call.
- Downloading a file from the server.
- Moving a file from one location to another on disk.
- Reading from a file.
- Writing to a file.
- Making a database query.
- Loading the Shared Preferences.

It starts the coroutine in the IO thread, it is used to perform all the data operations such as networking, reading, or writing from the database, reading, or writing to the files eg: Fetching data from the database is an IO operation, which is done on the IO thread.

```kt
GlobalScope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) {
    Log.i("Inside IO dispatcher ",Thread.currentThread().name.toString())
        // getting the name of thread in which
            // our coroutine has been launched
    }
    Log.i("Main Activity ",Thread.currentThread().name.toString())
```

#### **Default Dispatcher:**

We should use `Dispatchers.Default` to perform CPU-intensive tasks.

Example use cases:

- Doing heavy calculations like Matrix multiplications.
- Doing any operations on a bigger list present in the memory like sorting, filtering, searching, etc.
- Applying the filter on the Bitmap present in the memory, NOT by reading the image file present on the disk.
- Parsing the JSON available in the memory, NOT by reading the JSON file present on the disk.
- Scaling the bitmap already present in the memory, NOT by reading the image file present on the disk.
- Any operations on the bitmap that are already present in the memory, NOT by reading the image file present on the disk.

We should choose this when we are planning to do Complex and long-running calculations, which can block the main thread and freeze the UI.

Suppose we need to do the 10,000 calculations and we are doing all these calculations on the UI thread ie main thread, and if we wait for the result or 10,000 calculations, till that time our main thread would be blocked, and our UI will be frozen, leading to poor user experience. So in this case we need to use the Default Thread.

```kt
GlobalScope.launch(Dispatchers.Default) {
        Log.i("Inside Default dispatcher ",Thread.currentThread().name.toString())
            // getting the name of thread in which
            // our coroutine has been launched
        }
        Log.i("Main Activity ",Thread.currentThread().name.toString())
```

#### Coroutine Builders:

async and launch are the two ways to start the  coroutine.

There are two functions in Kotlin to start the coroutines which are as follows:

- `launch{}`: fire and forget
- `async{}`: perform a task and return a result

To launch a coroutine, we need to use a coroutine builder like *launch* or *async*. These builder functions are actually extensions of the *CoroutineScope* interface. 

The difference is that the `launch{}` returns a `Job` and does not carry any resulting value whereas the `async{}` returns an instance of `Deferred<T>`, which has an `await()` function that returns the result of the coroutine like we have future in Java in which we do `future.get()` to get the result.

lets see an example :

```kt
val job = GlobalScope.launch(Dispatchers.Default) {
    // do something and do not return result
}
```

It returns a job object which we can use to get a job's status or to cancel it.

following example we have to do something and **NOT** return the result back.

[`join`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-job/join.html) is used to wait for completion of the launched coroutine and it does not propagate its exception.

async :

```kt
val deferredJob = GlobalScope.async(Dispatchers.Default) {
    // do something and return result, for example 10 as a result
    return@async 10
}
val result = deferredJob.await() // result = 10
```

we get the result using the `await()`.

One important point to note is that Async makes both of the networks call for result1 and result2 in parallel.

whereas with launch parallel function calls are not made.

**When to Use Async?**

When making two or more network call in parallel, but you need to wait for the answers before computing the output, ie use async for results from multiple tasks that run in parallel. If you use async and do not wait for the result, it will work exactly the same as launch.

Another difference between launch and async is in terms of exception handling.

- launch : If any exception comes inside the **launch** block, it crashes the application if we have not handled it.

- async : However, if any exception comes inside the async block, it is stored inside the resulting `Deferred` and is not delivered anywhere else, it will get silently dropped unless we handle it.

`async` does return a `Deferred<>`, while `launch` does only return a `Job`, both start a new coroutine. So it depends if you require a return value or not.

### Scope in Coroutine :

scope in coroutine is  management the coroutine lifecycle

To launch a coroutine, we need to use a coroutine builder like *launch* or *async*. These builder functions are actually extensions of the *CoroutineScope* interface. So, whenever we want to launch a coroutine, we need to start it in some scope.

Scopes in Kotlin Coroutines are very useful because we need to cancel the background task as soon as the activity is destroyed.

Using a coroutine scope ensures that coroutines are properly managed and canceled when they are no longer needed, helping to avoid memory leaks and other issues.

There are different types of coroutine scopes available in Kotlin, such as:

1. GlobalScope: This scope is created when the application starts and lasts until the application terminates. It is not tied to any specific component or lifecycle.

2. CoroutineScope: This is a custom scope that can be created by the user to define the lifetime of coroutines. It can be tied to a specific component or lifecycle, such as an activity or fragment.

3. ViewModelScope: This is a scope that is tied to a ViewModel's lifecycle. Coroutines launched in this scope are automatically canceled when the associated ViewModel is destroyed.

4. LifecycleScope: This is a scope that is tied to a component's lifecycle, such as an activity or fragment. Coroutines launched in this scope are automatically canceled when the associated component is destroyed.

 There are basically **3 scopes** in Kotlin coroutines:

1. Global Scope
2. LifeCycle Scope
3. ViewModel Scope
- GlobalScope:
  
  When Coroutines are launched within the global scope, they live long as the application does.If the coroutines finish it’s a job, it will be destroyed and will not keep alive until the application dies, but let’s imagine a situation when the coroutines has some work or instruction left to do, and suddenly we end the application, then the coroutines will also die, as the maximum lifetime of the coroutine is equal to the lifetime of the application. Coroutines launched in the global scope will be launched in a separate thread.

The main problem with the coroutines launched in the global scope is that when the activity in which coroutines is launched dies, the coroutines will not die with the activity.

Since the coroutine is using the resources of the activity in which it is launched, and now since that activity has died, the resources will not be garbage collected as a coroutine is still referring to that resources.This problem can lead to a memory leak.So using global scope all the time is not always a good idea.

example :

```kt
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    val TAG = "Main Activity"
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        GlobalScope.launch {
            Log.d(TAG, Thread.currentThread().name.toString())
        }
        Log.d("Outside Global Scope", Thread.currentThread().name.toString())
    }
}
```

LifeCycle Scope :

```kt
  lifecycleScope.launch {
                while (true) {
                    delay(1000L)
                    Log.d(TAG, "Still Running..")
                }
            }
```

Viewmodel Scope :

coroutine in this scope will live as long the view model is alive.

### WithContext :

is a function provided by the Kotlin coroutine library that allows you to switch the context of a coroutine.

Since It is known that async is used to get the result back, & should be used only when we need the parallel execution, whereas the launch is used when we do not want to get the result back and is used for the operation such as updating of data, etc. As we know that async is the only way till now to start the coroutine and get the result back, but the problem with async arises when we do not want to make parallel network calls. It is known when async is used, one needs to use the **await()** function, which leads to blocking of the main thread, but here comes the concept of **withContext** which removes the problem of blocking the main thread.

withContext is nothing but another way of writing the async where one does not have to write **await()**. When withContext, is used, it runs the tasks in series instead of parallel. So one should remember that when we have a single task in the background and want to get back the result of that task, we should use withContext. Let us take an example which demonstrates the working of the withContext:

- `withContext` is a suspend function through which we can do a task by providing the `Dispatchers` on which we want the task to be done. `withContext` does not create a new coroutine, it only shifts the context of the existing coroutine and it's a suspend function whereas `launch` and `async` create a new coroutine and they are not suspend functions.



### runBlocking :

it's a coroutine builder like coroutine scope.

runBlocking is a coroutine function. By not providing any context, it will get run on the main thread.Runs a new coroutine and blocks the current thread interruptible until its completion. This function should not be used from a coroutine. It is designed to bridge regular blocking code to libraries that are written in suspending style, to be used in main functions and in tests.    

```kt
fun main() = runBlocking {
    launch {
        delay(1000L)
        println("World!")
    }
    println("Hello,")
}
```

In this example, `runBlocking` creates a new coroutine and blocks the main thread until the coroutine completes. The `launch` function inside the coroutine creates a new coroutine that suspends for 1 second using the `delay` function and then prints "World!

diffrent between coroutine scope and runblocking ?

- `runBlocking` is not a `suspend fun`. The thread that called it remains inside it until the coroutine is complete.

- `coroutineScope` is a `suspend fun`. If your coroutine suspends, the `coroutineScope` function gets suspended as well. This allows the top-level function, a *non-suspending* function that created the coroutine, to continue executing on the same thread. The thread has "escaped" the `coroutineScope` block and is ready to do some other work.
